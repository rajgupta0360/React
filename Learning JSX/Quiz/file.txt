Q - I want you to return an of array of cars, which will have atleast 5 different cars. The task is to create an ordered list.
    So your data should display like: 
    <ul>
        1. first car name
        2. second car name
        3. third car name
        4. fourth car name
        5. fifth car name
    </ul>
